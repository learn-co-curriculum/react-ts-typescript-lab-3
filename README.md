# TypeScript Lab 3

## Instructions

Create an HTML file that has 2 input fields to make the previous `prepend()`
function you created work with user input:

1. Have one input field for the actual text that needs to be padded with spaces
   at the beginning.
2. Have one input field for the actual number of spaces that the text should be
   prepended with.
3. Have a button that takes both values and performs the prepend action. Have
   the result of that action be displayed on the console.
